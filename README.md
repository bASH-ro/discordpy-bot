This is a beginner friendly base for creating a Discord bot in Discord.py. 

**How to setup:**

Assuming you already have Python installed via the official python website.

Run the following in cmd:
```pip install discord```,
```pip install os```,
```pip install asyncio```,
```pip install python-dotenv```,

There's your imports finished, now, if you don't already have a bot token, read this - https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

**Next Step:**
Go to the ```.env``` file and after the ```BOT_TOKEN=``` paste your bot token, no spaces, and no quotations.

**Last step:** 
Open cmd prompt and navigate to the location of your bot.py file and then execute following in console ```python bot.py```

**What the download contains:**

bot.py file - The file containing the bots code, nothing major here for now

.env file - For env vars on storing ur bot token, api keys and what not
